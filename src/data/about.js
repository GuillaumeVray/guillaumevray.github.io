  description: [
    "I aim to make computer vision systems more robust and reliable in the real world. My work spans test‑time adaptation, domain generalization, and learning under distribution shift across natural and medical imagery.",
    "I’ve authored 7+ publications at top venues (NeurIPS, ICLR, CVPR, MICCAI, IEEE T‑MI) and release reproducible, open‑source code that others can build on.",
    "I also care about teaching and communication: as Head TA for Image Analysis and Pattern Recognition (200 students), I led labs and launched a practical course project, earning a Teaching Assistant Award.",
    "I’m looking to create impact as an ML Engineer, Applied Scientist, or Research Scientist—bringing robust, well‑tested ideas from research into products and platforms.",
